# Given the participantâ€™s score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. 
# You have scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

# Sample input: [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]
# Sample output: 5

# Explanation: Given list is [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]. The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. 
# Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.

scores = [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]
unique_scores = list(set(scores))
unique_scores.sort(reverse=True)
print(unique_scores[1])
