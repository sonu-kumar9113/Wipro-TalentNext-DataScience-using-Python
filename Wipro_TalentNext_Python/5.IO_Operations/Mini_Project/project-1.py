# Your friend has sent you a text file containing n lines. He sent a secret message with it, which tells you the place and time where you have to go and meet him.
# He challenges you to find it out without seeing the content of the file. He has given hints to find it. Letâ€™s surprise him by breaking the challenge with our python code.

# Hints to find the secret message:
# The number of lines in the file tells you the meeting time.
# Note: 1 <= number of lines <= 24

# If the number of lines is exceeding 12, you need to convert it to 12 hour format. 
#For example,
# If the number of lines is 15, then the meeting time is 3 PM.
# If the number of lines is 10, then the meeting time is 10 AM.

# The word appearing for the maximum number of times tells you the meeting place.
# Note: Meeting place will be a street name.
# For example,
# If the word Oxford appears for the maximum number of times, then meeting place is Oxford Street.
# If the word Park appears for the maximum number of times, then meeting place is Park Street.
