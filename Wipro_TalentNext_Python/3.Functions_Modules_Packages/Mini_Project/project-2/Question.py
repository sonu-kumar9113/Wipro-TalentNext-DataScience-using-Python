# Create a Python module with the following functions:

#    Function Name	                Task
# ispalindrome(name)	        Given the user name as input, this function should tell us whether the name is a palindrome or not.
# count_the_vowels(name)	    Given the user name as input, this function should tell us how many vowels are present in it.
# frequency_of_letters(name)	Given the user name as input, this function should tell us how many times each letter appears in the name.

# Note:
# name will be completely in either lower case or upper case.

# Import the module in another Python script and test the functions by passing appropriate inputs.

# Sample input 1:
# bob
# Sample output 1:
# yaml
# Copy
# Edit
# Yes it is a palindrome.
# No of vowels: 1
# Frequency of letters: b-2, o-1

# Sample input 2:
# marcel bentok tanaka
# Sample output 2:
# less
# Copy
# Edit
# No it is not a palindrome.
# No of vowels: 7
# Frequency of letters: m-1, a-4, r-1, c-1, e-2, l-1, b-1, n-2, t-2, o-1, k-2
